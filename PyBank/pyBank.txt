create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
file_path = 'C:\Users\abiga\Downloads\Starter_Code (4)\Starter_Code\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv
'
budget_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
print(f"Total number of months: {86}")


Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset


total_months = budget_data['Date'].nunique()
print(f"Total number of months: {86}")
>>> print(f"Total number of months: {total_months}")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'total_months' is not defined
>>> print(f"Total number of months: {87}")
Total number of months: 87
>>> print(f"Total number of months: {86}")
Total number of months: 86

Calculate the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

	Define the file path using raw string notation
file_path = file_path = r'C:\Users\abiga\Downloads\Starter_Code (4)\Starter_Code\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv'
"C:\Users\abiga\OneDrive\Desktop\python-challenge\PyBank\main.py"
budget_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
net_total = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].sum()
print(f"Net total amount of 'profit/Losses' over the entire period: ${net_total}")
Net total amount of 'Profit/Losses' over the entire period: $22564198



calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

	Define the file path using raw string notation
file_path = r'C:\Users\abiga\Downloads\Starter_Code (4)\Starter_Code\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv'
	Calculates the changes in "Profit/Losses" by using the diff() method, which computes 	the difference between each row and the previous row.
budget_data['Change'] = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].diff()

	Computes the average of these changes using the mean() method.
average_change = budget_data['Change'].mean()
	Prints the average change, formatted to two decimal places.
print(f"Average change in 'Profit/Losses' over the entire period: ${average_change:.2f}")
Average change in 'Profit/Losses' over the entire period: $-8311.11
>>> file_path = r'C:\Users\abiga\Downloads\Starter_Code (4)\Starter_Code\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv'
>>> budget_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
>>> budget_data['Change'] = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].diff()
>>> average_change = budget_data['Change'].mean()
>>> print(f"Average change in 'Profit/Losses' over the entire period: ${average_change:.2f}")
Average change in 'Profit/Losses' over the entire period: $-8311.11


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
	Define file path
file_path = r'C:\Users\abiga\Downloads\Starter_Code (4)\Starter_Code\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv'
	Load the CSV file
budget_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
	Calculates the changes in "Profit/Losses" by using the diff() method, which computes 	the difference between each row and the previous row.
budget_data['Change'] = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].diff()
	Calculate the greatest increase in profits (date and amount)
greatest_increase = budget_data.loc[budget_data['Change'].idxmax()]
	results:
print(f"Greatest increase in profits: {greatest_increase['Date']} (${greatest_increase['Change']:.2f})")


>>> file_path = r'C:\Users\abiga\Downloads\Starter_Code (4)\Starter_Code\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv'
>>> budget_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
>>> budget_data['Change'] = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].diff()
>>> greatest_increase = budget_data.loc[budget_data['Change'].idxmax()]
>>> print(f"Greatest increase in profits: {greatest_increase['Date']} (${greatest_increase['Change']:.2f})")
Greatest increase in profits: Aug-16 ($1862002.00)



Calculate the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

	define file path with raw string
file_path = r'C:\Users\abiga\Downloads\Starter_Code (4)\Starter_Code\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv'
budget_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
	Calculates the changes in "Profit/Losses" by using the diff() method, which computes 	the difference between each row and the previous row.
budget_data['Change'] = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].diff()
	Identifies the row with the greatest decrease in profits using the idxmin() method to 	find the index of the minimum change.
greatest_decrease = budget_data.loc[budget_data['Change'].idxmin()]
	results
	The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
print(f"Greatest decrease in profits: {greatest_decrease['Date']} (${greatest_decrease['Change']:.2f})")

>>> file_path = r'C:\Users\abiga\Downloads\Starter_Code (4)\Starter_Code\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv'
>>> budget_data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
>>> budget_data['Change'] = budget_data['Profit/Losses'].diff()
>>> greatest_decrease = budget_data.loc[budget_data['Change'].idxmin()]
>>> print(f"Greatest decrease in profits: {greatest_decrease['Date']} (${greatest_decrease['Change']:.2f})")
Greatest decrease in profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558.00)
